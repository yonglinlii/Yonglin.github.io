  <h1>Reflection on Susan Sontag’s "In Plato’s Cave"</h1>

  <p>Photos are ubiquitous in my daily life. Whether on Instagram, TikTok, or other social media platforms, 
    I’m constantly bombarded with images, travel videos, shopping photos, foodie getaways, and so on,
    posted by friends and strangers alike. 
    And I‘m truly captivated by these beautiful photos. They influence my moods and even dictate where I go and what I do.

  </p>

  <p>For a while during summer vacation, my phone was completely flooded with beautiful photos of Cape May, New Jersey, its famous pink bungalows, fresh lobsters, and pristine beaches. 
    The photos were so captivating that I decided to go there the next day. It was indeed beautiful in many ways: the beach was clean, the lobsters were fresh, large, and inexpensive, 
    and I even took a photo in front of the pink house. However, the reality was much more complex than the photos suggested. They didn’t reveal how scattered Cape May is, with streets mostly lined with residential areas.
    Most restaurants require a car to reach, and I didn’t have a car. Since I wasn’t familiar with the area, I didn’t dare take the bus, so I walked for an hour before finding a seafood restaurant. The restaurant was packed, 
    and I had to wait two hours for my meal. I was so frustrated that I gave up and walked another hour back to the hotel. The photos had made me think Cape May was perfect, but they only showed the beauty, not the underlying troubles.

  <p>It’s like Susan Sontag’s metaphor from Plato’s “Allegory of the Cave”. I only saw the beautiful part, so I assumed everything about Cape May would be perfect,
    but I overlooked the underlying issues. Just like the people in the cave who only saw the shadows and thought that was all there was to it. I agree with Susan Sontag’s point 
    that photos can only reveal the surface, not the whole truth. 

  </p>

  <p>I’ve often been deceived by photos myself. I’ve found that photography has truly transformed my relationship with the world. I’m a huge camera lover. Whenever I travel, I always have my phone in hand, because I believe
    a photo can forever preserve a moment.But this habit sometimes makes me neglect experiencing the scenery itself. Instead of simply admiring the scenery, I’m constantly preoccupied with angling my phone, composing the shot, 
    and pressing the shutter button. Even though I know I’ll miss the true beauty of the moment, I can’t help but take photos. As Susan Sontag says, photographs can create lasting memories, but they can also make us lose something of the experience.
  </p>


  <p> Through these experiences, I’ve come to understand the dual nature of photography, it can preserve the beauty of the present moment, but it can also simplify and deceive. In future classes, I hope to use photography 
    more effectively, not just to record and showcase superficial beauty, but to use images to tell deeper stories, to encourage people to consider the truth behind the images, rather than just looking at the surface.
