    <h1>Edited Photo 1 (1920x1080)</h1>

I chose this photo because I really enjoy using sunlight as a natural filter. 
I love how the scenery looks when it is lit by the sun. 
When I first took this picture, it was slightly overexposed, so I adjusted the brightness 
to make it less harsh. By lowering the exposure, I was able to balance the light and 
make the photo look more natural, without being too bright.
