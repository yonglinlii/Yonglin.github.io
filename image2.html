    <h1>Edited Photo 2 (5x7 inches)</h1>
    <img src="photo2.jpg" width="600">

    <p>
I chose this photo because I like unposed photos,
but rather, I like to capture the genuine moments of people going about their daily lives.
I really enjoyed the natural feel of the scene when I took this photo.
Everyone was busy with their own things, and this photo shows real life,
not staged. That's why I felt this photo was worth editing and saving.
